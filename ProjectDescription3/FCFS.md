## Introduction
The **FCFS Process Scheduler** is a fundamental simulation of process management within an operating system. In FCFS, processes are executed in the order they arrive, ensuring simplicity and fairness but potentially leading to high waiting times for longer processes.

## Features
- **Process Management**: Add, view, and manage processes with their arrival times and burst times.
- **Scheduling Algorithm**: Implements the FCFS scheduling algorithm.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates and displays average waiting time and turnaround time.
- **Interactive CLI**: User-friendly command-line interface for interaction.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the FCFS Process Scheduler on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- **C Compiler**: `gcc` for C implementation.
- **.NET SDK**: For C# implementation.

### Installation

#### C Implementation
